This directory contains the files that I used in the course of writing my Master's thesis. 
Unfortunately, the .xlsx file with the data could not be uploaded because of its size. 
However, the data used to train the models in the file Comp_ANN_Final.ipynb can be downloaded using the 
Barchart Plug-In for Excel: https://www.barchart.com/excel 

The market data for all other files is downloaded from Yahoo!Finance in the code itself. 

Feel free to use, improve the codes in this directory and contact me!
